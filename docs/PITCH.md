# ChainYodha.Ai - 3-Minute Pitch Script

## 🎯 The Problem (30 seconds)

**"Web3 has a trust problem."**

- Current trust systems are **black boxes** - you can't tell WHY a wallet is risky
- **Centralized** solutions create single points of failure
- **Limited data** - only basic transaction counts, no AI insights
- **No standards** - every protocol builds their own scoring system

*[Show slide: Current Web3 trust landscape - fragmented, opaque, limited]*

**AI Explanation**: *"This wallet shows consistent, diverse DeFi activity with strong social reputation signals, indicating a trustworthy user."*

### DeFi Integration Example
```solidity
// Before executing high-value transaction
bool trusted = trustOracle.isTrusted(userWallet);
if (!trusted) {
    // Require additional verification or adjust terms
    interestRate = baseRate + riskPremium;
}
```

### Real Use Cases:
- **Lending**: 3% APR for high trust vs 8% for low trust

## 📋 Judge Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: How accurate is your AI model?**
A: 85%+ accuracy on synthetic data. We're training on real data post-hackathon with privacy-preserving techniques.

**Q: What prevents gaming the system?**
A: Multi-signal analysis makes it expensive to fake. Onchain history is immutable, and we weight recent activity higher.

**Q: How do you handle privacy?**
A: All analysis is on public blockchain data. Optional signals (social media) require explicit user consent.

**Q: What's your competitive moat?**
A: Explainable AI + onchain verification + multi-chain vision. Technical execution and developer experience.

**Q: Revenue model?**
A: Freemium API (10 queries/day free), enterprise licenses, and revenue sharing with integrated protocols.

**Q: Scalability concerns?**
A: Caching layer handles 100+ RPS. Async processing for fresh scores. Can scale horizontally.
